## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to replicate a specific animation from GrowthX Club using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React + Vite)**. The focus is on performance, smooth animation, and frontend development skills.

## Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React (with Vite)
- 🟦 TypeScript
- 🎨 CSS

## Project Structure

## Notes

- ❌ **No dynamic imports**: All critical assets and animation code are statically loaded to ensure instant animation rendering on page load.
- ⚡ **Optimized for performance**: Animation starts immediately when the page loads.
- 🔁 **CSS re-triggerable animation**: The animation can be re-triggered through CSS classes (e.g., by toggling classes or re-rendering).
- 🎨 **No Lottie used**: Animation is built purely with web technologies as per the assignment requirements.

## AI Usage

I used AI tools during development to assist with:

- Debugging animation timing issues.
- Writing performant CSS for smoother transitions.
